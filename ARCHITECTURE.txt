Swaasthya-Saathi — System Architecture and Workflow

Overview
Swaasthya-Saathi is a multi-part system that turns WhatsApp interactions and user images into language-localized voice guidance and a simple dashboard experience. It comprises:
- Node.js WhatsApp bot backend (Express + Twilio Webhooks)
- AI services for vision, LLM reasoning, translation, and TTS
- A Next.js Dashboard app (mobile-focused UI) for viewing prescriptions and nearby stores
- A Python FastAPI “medical-api-endpoints” microservice that structures medical content and performs safer Q&A

Key External Services
- Twilio WhatsApp: inbound/outbound messaging and media
- Groq Cloud LLM/VLM: image understanding, Q&A, JSON reasoning
- Sarvam.ai TTS & STT: speech generation (Bulbul) and speech-to-text (Saarika)
- ffmpeg: media transcoding and concatenation
- Ngrok (or public host): serving generated MP3s from backend/public

Repositories/Apps
- backend/ (Express server, WhatsApp flow, media hosting)
- dashboard/ (Next.js app for user UI)
- Frontend/swaasthya-saathi-frontend/ (marketing/landing front-end)
- medical-api-endpoints/ (FastAPI microservice for medical summarization & Q&A)

Data Flow (High-Level)
1) User sends a prescription image on WhatsApp.
2) Backend downloads media from Twilio, hosts it, and calls Groq VLM to derive a clean, patient-facing text summary. The summary is refined via the Python medical API into a structured and simplified instruction set.
3) Backend asks the user to pick a preferred language and can generate an audio summary via Sarvam.ai TTS. MP3s are hosted at /static and linked back via Twilio.
4) The user can send medicine label images. The backend uses Groq to decide if it is a medicine, match against the prescription, and produce instructions. Responses are localized (translation + numeral localization) and optionally converted to speech.
5) The user can send voice questions. Audio is converted (ffmpeg) and transcribed (Sarvam.ai STT). The question is answered by Groq LLM with the prescription summary as context, translated/localized, and optionally spoken via TTS.
6) The dashboard app provides a separate UI showcasing sample prescriptions, a modal view, and a nearby stores map. (No direct persistence from WhatsApp flow is wired currently.)

Core Backend Architecture (backend/)
- server.js
  - Express app, serves /static from backend/public with Content-Type fix for .mp3
  - Parses x-www-form-urlencoded for Twilio webhooks
  - Mounts webhook routes

- src/routes/webhook.js
  - Single POST /whatsapp-webhook entrypoint
  - Maintains an in-memory userState keyed by WhatsApp number:
    - waitingForLanguage, summary, expectingVoice, languageCode, languageLabel, awaitingMedicinePhoto
  - Handlers:
    - Session reset: text "done"
    - Link shortcut: "link" or "🔗" returns dashboard URL
    - Language selection: numeric option 1–9 sets language state and sends audio prompt; enables voice Q&A
    - Prescription image step:
      1. downloadTwilioMedia(image)
      2. getImagePrescriptionSummary(imageUrl) via Groq VLM → refined by medical API
      3. ask for language; prepare for medicine photos
    - Medicine image step:
      1. analyzeMedicineImage(summary, imageUrl, lang)
      2. Always return instructions or extracted text; optionally TTS
    - Voice follow-up step:
      1. Download & convert OGG→WAV (ffmpeg)
      2. Sarvam.ai STT → transcript
      3. answerQuestionWithContext(summary, transcript, lang) via Groq → translate/localize → TTS (optional)

- src/services/groq.js
  - getImagePrescriptionSummary(imageUrl)
    - Groq VLM extracts plain patient instructions from image
    - Calls medical-api-endpoints /summarize-prescription to structure/normalize and then refines via Groq into final plain summary
  - analyzeMedicineImage(summary, imageUrl, targetLang)
    - VLM JSON result: is_medicine, matches_prescription, medicine_name, instructions, warning
    - OCR fallback: extract text, re-evaluate as JSON
    - Translates and localizes instructions/warnings to targetLang
  - answerQuestionWithContext(summary, question, targetLang)
    - Long-form safe medical answer (system prompt)
    - Ensures minimum length; expansion if too short
    - Translates and localizes numerals/words

- src/services/translate.js
  - translateText(text, targetLang, sourceLang='auto') with Groq primary and Google public translate fallback
  - replaceNumbersWithWords: for Hindi, convert numbers to words with domain tweaks (e.g., “mg”)
  - convertAsciiDigitsToNative: maps 0–9 to local scripts (hi/bn/gu/ta/te/kn/ml/etc.)

- src/services/tts.js
  - generateSpeechFromText(text, langCode, timestamp)
    - Splits long text into chunks
    - Sarvam.ai Bulbul TTS per chunk → raw → ffmpeg to mp3
    - Concatenates chunk MP3s into final /public/answer_<timestamp>.mp3
    - Returns ngrokDomain/static/answer_<timestamp>.mp3 URL

- src/utils/media.js (downloadTwilioMedia)
  - Downloads Twilio-hosted media, writes to backend/public, returns hosted URL for Groq and Twilio replies

- src/config/env.js
  - Handles NGROK_DOMAIN, GROQ_API_KEY, SARVAM_API_KEY, Twilio creds, etc.

Medical API (medical-api-endpoints/)
- app/main.py (FastAPI)
  - /summarize-prescription
    - Safety prefilter
    - run_summarize → paragraph draft (LangChain to II medical model)
    - refine_prescription_to_json → strict JSON schema (PrescriptionSummary)
  - /answer-query
    - Safety prefilter
    - Retrieval: in-code Indian medicines context + optional prescription-derived context
    - run_qa → paragraph draft
    - refine_answer_to_json → strict schema with safety footer and sources
- app/chains/medical_model.py
  - LangChain pipelines that produce the draft paragraphs from II medical model
- app/chains/gpt_refiner.py, safety.py, retrieval.py, schemas.py
  - JSON enforcement, disclaimers, domain knowledge snippets, and Pydantic models

Dashboard (dashboard/)
- Next.js app with mobile-first UI components:
  - app/page.js: composes sections: HealthSnapshotCards, PrescriptionsCarousel, NearbyStoresMap, QuickActions, and a PrescriptionModal
  - lib/samplePrescriptions.js and lib/sampleStores.js: mock data for demo
  - components/NearbyStoresMap.js: react-leaflet or graceful fallback with store list and controls
  - No live link to WhatsApp session yet (sample/demo content)

Landing Frontend (Frontend/swaasthya-saathi-frontend/)
- Vite + React marketing site with Hero, TechStack, etc.

End-to-End WhatsApp Flow (Step-by-step)
1. Incoming message → Twilio hits backend POST /whatsapp-webhook (x-www-form-urlencoded)
2. If image and no summary:
   a. Save image → public URL
   b. Groq VLM → initial plain instructions
   c. Python API /summarize-prescription → structured and refined summary
   d. Ask for language → send audio list (TTS Hindi by default)
   e. Set userState: waitingForLanguage=true, awaitingMedicinePhoto=true
3. Language selection (1–9):
   a. Translate summary to selected language
   b. Generate TTS in langCode, reply with MP3 (or text fallback)
   c. Enable expectingVoice=true for follow-up voice Q&A
4. Medicine label images:
   a. Groq VLM classify & compare with prescription; produce instructions or text extraction
   b. Translate/localize and TTS reply in selected language
5. Voice notes:
   a. Download OGG → convert to WAV via ffmpeg
   b. Sarvam.ai STT → transcript
   c. Groq LLM QA with prescription summary as context → translate/localize → TTS
6. "done" resets user session state; "link" or "🔗" returns dashboard URL

State & Persistence
- userState is in-memory (per-process) and volatile. There is no DB in the current code. Scaling to multiple instances requires shared state (e.g., Redis) and a media/object store for images/audio (e.g., S3) rather than local disk.

Security & Privacy Considerations
- Media is stored under backend/public and publicly served. Replace with time-scoped URLs and private storage in production.
- API keys for Groq/Sarvam/Twilio must be secured via environment variables and secrets management.
- Add authentication/authorization for dashboard if connecting real user data.

Operational Notes
- ffmpeg is required on the host/container for audio conversions and concatenation
- /static path serves mp3 with correct Content-Type
- Ngrok domain is used to expose local server and to allow Twilio and WhatsApp to fetch media

Future Integration Ideas
- Persist structured summaries and media to a database; connect Dashboard to real data
- Add user auth and secure link from WhatsApp to Dashboard profile
- Replace in-memory state with Redis and move files to cloud storage (S3/GCS)
- Add webhook verification and request signing checks
- Robust error handling and retries for external calls
